# The problem

::: {.notes}
* A few government spreadsheets that demonstrate a lack of consistent style and the need for accessibility improvements
* The intent is to demonstrate opportunity, not to call anyone out
:::

## {background-image='images/spreadsheet_csps-2019.png'}

::: {.notes}
* [Link to page](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-people-survey-2019-results)

  - empty rows, columns
  - merged cells
  - vertical text
  - double headers
  - no true header for column A
  - section headers _within_ column A
  - different font sizes

::: {.notes}
* [Link to page](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2022-to-2023-season)
* Issues include:
  - image
  - empty rows, columns, cells (including A1)
  - two tables, no forewarning
  - gridlines sometimes missing, sometimes not
:::

## {background-image='images/spreadsheet_fuel-xlsx.png'}

::: {.notes}
* [Link to page](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/weekly-road-fuel-prices)
* Issues include:
  - image
  - empty rows, columns, cells, headers
  - numbers not in cells
  - units in separate, unlabelled column
  - alt text doesn't help
* The cover page does not indicate that the spreadsheet is not accessible
* Perhaps there's a machine-readable CSV?
:::

## {background-image='images/spreadsheet_fuel-csv.png'}

::: {.notes}
* [Link to page](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/weekly-road-fuel-prices)
* The CSV isn't truly machine-readable either
* Issues include:
  - empty rows, columns, cells, headers
  - double headers
  - sub-tables (acronyms and rates) not obvious

* Hannah Thomas works in the Analysis Function
* Hannah wrote a great blog about accessibility empathy for spreadsheet users

## {background-image='images/spreadsheet_empathy-hidden.png'}

::: {.notes}
* [Link to page](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/blog/accessibility-empathy-for-users-of-spreadsheets/)
* In the blog there is a downloadable spreadsheet and the idea is to answer some questions about the data in the file.
* But! All of its cells are blacked out.
* It 'shows you what it is like trying to navigate a data table when you cannot see the layout. 
* 'This should give you some idea of the issues faced by users with visual impairments.'

## {background-image='images/spreadsheet_empathy-revealed.png'}

::: {.notes}
* [Link to page](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/blog/accessibility-empathy-for-users-of-spreadsheets/)
* When you reveal the data (spoiler alert!) you can see how you could be tripped up by missing rows, for example.
:::

# Another problem

::: {.notes}
* The accessibility issue is a gaping one
* But maybe its driven partly by processes?
:::

## Steps to publish

1. Prepare and save individual tables
2. Copy-paste into spreadsheet
3. Format

::: {.incremental}
4. Spot a mistake
5. Repeat the above
6. Publish (fingers-crossed)
:::

::: {.notes}
* Problem: inertia, risk
* Stattos already have systems in place
* Time consuming to rework production pipeline
* Everyone can perform point-and-click tasks 
:::

# Making it better

::: {.notes}
* It's easy to complain
* What are we doing about it?

* [Link to page](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/the-code/value/v4-innovation-and-improvement/)
* This is really important, obviously, but accessibility is also one of the 'values' pillars in the Code of Practice for Statistics
* If your stats publication doesn't adhere, then you are breaking the code

::: {.notes}
* [Link to page](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/reproducible-analytical-pipelines-strategy/)
* Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) is a grassroots movement that's been bubbling around UK government for a few years
* It's even spread to other countries and to non-governmental organisations
* RAPs are 'automated statistical and analytical processes [that] incorporate elements of software engineering best practice to ensure that the pipelines are reproducible, auditable, efficient, and high quality.'
* Automated and version controlled with open software
* If you're producing a spreadsheet, it's production should be part of a RAP!
:::

# Practical help 

::: {.notes}
* Many teams have applied the advice to their publications
* There are still opportunities
* How can we make things easier:
  - as part of a RAP?
  - for entry-level coders?
  - by taking into account the realities of 'at the coalface' production?
  - by taking the initiative?
  - to prevent duplication of effort?

::: {.notes}
* [Link to page](https://gptables.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* This is a 'bottom-up' approach, but is 'official' in that it's produced by the Analysis Function
* Written for Python, convert pandas dataframes
* Can be accessed from R via the {reticulate} package, but requires a Python installation and understanding of {reticulate}
:::

## {background-image='images/website_a11ytables-docs.png'}

::: {.notes}
* [Link to page](https://co-analysis.github.io/a11ytables/)
* Bottom-up to solve my own needs, with wider implications
* R-native solution
* Created to comply with the _latest_ best practice guidance for releasing stats in spreadsheets, which gptables did not do at the time
* Slight differences to gptables that may be cleared up with time
:::

## Requirements

1. Simple
2. Opinionated
3. Compliant

::: {.notes}
* Should be simple for end-user, developer
* Simplicity means decisions must be made on behalf of the user
* Should meet the guidance
:::

## 1. Simple

* Suitable for beginner-level R users
* Automatic, everything taken care of
* Only two main functions in the package
* Familiar dataframes, pipeable
* Two dependencies: {openxlsx}, {pillar}

## 2. Opinionated

* Enforcement is good
* Styles and layout enforced to meet guidance
* Some choices have to be made, like pre-table metadata
* Some flexibly lost, not all spreadsheets are simple
* But you can amend the a11ytable and Workbook

## 3. Compliant

* The whole point is to meet the guidance
* {a11ytables} accessibility checklist vignette
* Handles compliance consistently, without fail

# How

## Premise

```{r}
create_a11ytable() |>
  generate_workbook() |> 
  openxlsx::saveWorkbook()
```

::: {.notes}
* Organise the required information (supporting and stat tables) into a special dataframe with additional class 'a11ytable'
* Convert to {openxlsx} 'Workbook' class with structure and style information
* Write that object to an xlsx file
:::

## Install

```{r}
install.packages("remotes")  # if not already installed
remotes::install_github("co-analysis/a11ytables")
```

::: {.notes}
* GitHub only for now
* Is this a barrier in some orgs?
* Still in development, but it has reached version 0.1
* CRAN is a future goal, maybe
:::

## Create

```{r}
x <- create_a11ytable(
    tab_titles,   # required char vector
    sheet_types,  # required char vector
    sheet_titles, # required char vector
    blank_cells,  # optional char vector
    sources,      # optional char vector
    tables        # listcol of dataframes
)
```

* Basically just creates a dataframe from the args
* Validates, warns, errors, corrects


## An a11ytable

```{r}
#| echo=FALSE,
#| eval=TRUE
library(a11ytables)
x <- as_a11ytable(mtcars_df)
x
```

::: {.notes}
* Familiar dataframe
* Row per sheet
* Columns for information, including listcol of dataframes
* Tables of information hold major content for each sheet
:::

## Structure

```{r}
#| echo=FALSE,
#| eval=TRUE
str(x, max.level = 1, strict.width = "cut")
```

::: {.notes}
* Output has classes 'a11ytable', 'tbl', 'data.frame'
:::

## Warnings

::: {.notes}
* Will error if something badly wrong
* Will warn about certain things to fix
* Will make some adjustments automatically
:::

## Workbook

```{r}
y <- generate_workbook(x)
openxlsx::saveWorkbook(y)
```

* Creates an {openxlsx} Workbook-class object
* Contains all the structure and style information to make a workbook
* This object can be written directly to xlsx
* There's already a function in {openxlsx} to write
* Didn't combine these steps so that the user can inspect and adjust the Workbook-class object if they wish

## Output xlsx

* Preview of each sheet in the workbook
* Attention to 
  * workbook structure: cover, contents, notes, tables
  * sheet structure: title, pre-table elements, table
  * marked up tables
  * no empty rows, columns; blanks explained

## S3 class

```{r}
as_a11ytable()  # supply compliant pre-written df
is_a11ytable()  # logical check
summary.a11ytable()  # print basic overview
tbl_sum.a11ytable()  # to print tibble-like output
```

## RStudio Addin

* Inserts skeletons for you
* With data.frames or tibbles
* Parts of workflow (table prep, pre-filled create_a11ytable call) or full workflow

::: {.notes}
* Another way to limit friction
* {tibble}-based option included
:::

## Dev simplicity (?)

* `as_a11ytable()` just makes a dataframe with validation
* `generate_workbook()` has `add_*()`



# But

## Limitations

* Saves to xlsx, not ODS
* Can't update properties
* Some flexibility lost in e.g. cover layout
* Surely it's still better to get 95% of the way there?
* Human should always be checking anyway

# Future


## Todo

* ODS conversion (command line?)
* YAML input (easier to provide text inputs)
* 'Advanced' input?
* Arbitrary, but controlled, pre-table meta?
* User research
* Bugfixes
* Features (in line with guidance)
* When I have the time

# If all else fails

* Untidy, inaccessible spreadsheets pose a particular problem for further analysis
* See [Duncan Garmonsway]()'s [{tidyxl}]() and [{unpivotr}]() R packages for help
* I want to help limit the need for these tools (sorry Duncan)

## Consider

1. How could you improve user experience?
1. Do you have the right processes in place?
1. Could you create tools to remove friction?
