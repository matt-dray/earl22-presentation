My talk at [EARL 2022](https://www.ascent.io/earl/) about [the {a11ytables} R package](https://co-analysis.github.io/a11ytables/index.html), titled 'Create reproducible and accessible spreadsheets with {a11ytables}'.

Scheduled for Thursday 8 September 2022, 1100 (session 2) in Stream 1 Tower 1.

You can [view the slides online](https://matt-dray.github.io/earl22-presentation/).

The slides are made with [Revealjs via Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/), converted them to PDF using [`renderthis::to_pdf("index.html")`](https://jhelvy.github.io/renderthis/) (note to self: reduce `$code-block-font-size` to `20px`).
